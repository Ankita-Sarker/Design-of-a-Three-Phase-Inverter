This project presents the design, simulation, and analysis of a three-phase voltage source
inverter using the Typhoon HIL real-time simulation platform. The objective was to
convert a DC input into a balanced three-phase AC output for industrial and grid-based
applications. The inverter uses six IGBT switches in a three-leg bridge configuration,
driven by Sinusoidal Pulse Width Modulation (SPWM). An LCL filter was incorporated
to reduce switching harmonics and improve output waveform quality.
The circuit was developed entirely in Typhoon HIL Control Center, allowing real-time
simulation and interaction without physical hardware. Measurements confirmed balanced
output waveforms, with a line-to-line voltage of 110V and phase current of 5A under an
R-L load. The system maintained low total harmonic distortion (THD < 5%) and good
dynamic stability.
This simulation-based approach enables safe, flexible, and efficient testing of inverter
systems, providing a strong foundation for future expansion into motor drives, advanced
control strategies, and hardware implementation.
